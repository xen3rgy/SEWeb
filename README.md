# Unsre Speis Web Application

This demo contains a small Node.js backend together with the static frontend. To start the application run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 and serves the HTML pages from `Unsre_Speis_Website_FUNKTIONAL`. API endpoints are available under `/api/*` for managing suppliers, products and viewing inventory. Data is persisted in `data.json`.
